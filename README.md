## Project Structure

The main application lives in `Project-prompter/`.

```text
Project-prompter/
  src/
    components/           # UI components and feature modules
    services/             # Google auth, sync, notifications, shortcuts
    stores/               # Zustand store(s)
    utils/                # parsing, import analysis, preview mapping
    test/                 # Vitest tests and setup
    App.tsx               # App shell and routing
    main.tsx              # Vite entry
  public/                 # PWA assets, manifest, icons
  tailwind.config.js
  vite.config.ts
  vitest.config.ts
  package.json
  bun.lock
```

Notable components to explore:
- `components/PromptEditor.tsx` — core authoring surface
- `components/ProjectBrowser.tsx` — project-level organization
- `components/MiniStructureEditor.tsx` — compact structure manipulation
- `components/ExportOptionsModal.tsx` — export/share workflows
- `components/EnhancedSearchBar.tsx` and `components/AdvancedSearch.tsx` — discovery and navigation
